TraITOCWS is a Java library accompanied by some small utility programs that together facilitate ODM [1] data loading into OpenClinica web services. The library augments OpenClinica standard functionality by supporting study subject creation and event scheduling based on the ODM data loaded. The functionality of the library is driven by information readily present in the ODM data format complemented with a small number of extra attributes. The library is intended for use in the Mirth Connect messaging hub but can also be used in a stand-alone fashion. For data loading into OpenClinica knowledge of the study data is loaded into is required. The TraITOCWS allows for the generation of study-specific ODM templates that can consequently be populated and loaded into OpenClinica. If data is loaded for existing study into an already scheduled event for an existing study subject, data can be imported directly through the dataImport() web service method of the OpenClinica web services. If a subject is to be created and/or an event is to be scheduled beforehand, additional calls need to be made. The TraITOCWS library handles these calls transparently.
